# Yelp Dataset Visualization

This project is a visualization tool for Yelp Challenge Dataset written in Django and leaflet / d3.


This application does not use any database. Yelp dataset is stored in rootDirectory/business/data/yelp
###### Format: JSON dataset.
###### Files used from [yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
1. business
2. checkin
3. review
4. tip
5. user - Didn't found enough time to use user json. But will keep this incase of furthur enhancement

The main idea was to cluster the data based on categories of different business.
